      - Nostalgic!
    - Dislikes:
      - Kind of disorganized
      - Seems difficult to moderate/scale up
  - [Play Exquisite Corpse](https://www.playexquisitecorpse.com/)
    - Likes:
      - A good adaptation of the original art game into web format
      - Has a gallery of other players' work
    - Dislikes:
      - Creations often have different color schemes
      - Due to the online nature, some of the drawings are crude
  - **How my applicaiton will be different:**
    - Will keep drawing controls as simple as possible
    - Drawings might be limited to color palettes chosen by the person drawing the head
    - Person drawing torso gets... something
    - Person who draws legs gets to name the monster based on adjectives/nouns supplied by previous two players
    - May have an option to let players rate their drawings as "adult" so that other players can choose to filter NSFW drawings
